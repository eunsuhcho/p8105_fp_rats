### Tentative project title

Do the rats run this city or do we?

### Project motivation

Rats have continuously posed a health and infrastructure risk to NYC and
its residents, and despite numerous attempts by the city to curb the
pervasive nature of the animals, rats are seen daily and have cemented
themselves as a part of NYC culture. We are aiming to analyze the
relationship between rat sightings in NYC and features of NYC, including
population density, income level, and stray cat density.
